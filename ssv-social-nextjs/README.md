# Social login with Openfort

NextAuth.js is a complete open-source authentication solution.

This is an example application that shows how `next-auth` is applied to a basic Next.js app with Openfort.


## Demo

This demo authenticates a player using NextAuth. It will create a custodial account for the player.


## Features

- 🍨 Next.JS as ⚛️ React client framework with NextAuth for authentication.
  

## How to run locally

**1. Clone and configure the sample**

```
git clone https://github.com/openfort-xyz/samples
cd ssv-social-nextjs
```

Copy the .env.example file into a file named .env in the folder of the server you want to use. For example:

```
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

You will need an Openfort account in order to run the demo. Once you set up your account, go to the Openfort [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/apikeys) to find your API keys.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENFORT_PUBLIC_KEY=<replace-with-your-publishable-key>
NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_SECRET_KEY=<replace-with-your-secret-key>
```

The other environment variables are configurable:

`NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is a secret used for signing cookies. It can be any random string.

`NEXTAUTH_URL` is the URL of the server. By default, it is set to `http://localhost:3000` and does not need to be modified unless you change the port number or host name.

Add details for one or more providers (e.g. Google, Twitter, GitHub, Email, etc).


**2. Configure Authentication Providers**

1. Review and update options in `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` as needed.

2. When setting up OAuth, in the developer admin page for each of your OAuth services, you should configure the callback URL to use a callback path of `{server}/api/auth/callback/{provider}`.

e.g. For Google OAuth you would use: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`

A list of configured providers and their callback URLs is available from the endpoint `/api/auth/providers`. You can find more information at https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/oauth

3. You can also choose to specify an SMTP server for passwordless sign in via email.

**2.1. Database**

A database is needed to persist user accounts and to support email sign in. However, you can still use NextAuth.js for authentication without a database by using OAuth for authentication. If you do not specify a database, [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction) will be enabled by default.

You **can** skip configuring a database and come back to it later if you want.

For more information about setting up a database, please check out the following links:

- Docs: [next-auth.js.org/adapters/overview](https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/overview)


**3. Create a Player, Policy and Contract**

[![Required](https://img.shields.io/badge/REQUIRED-TRUE-ORANGE.svg)](https://shields.io/)

You can create Policies and add Contracts in the Dashboard or with the API. This sample requires a Policy and a Contract to run. Once you've created them, and add its ID to your `.env`.

`NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_PLAYER` is the ID of a [Player](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api/players#create-a-player) for your player. 

`NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_CONTRACT` is the ID of a [Contract](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api/contracts#create-a-contract) for your contract. A contract has a chain_id. 
If you need a test contract address, use 0x38090d1636069c0ff1Af6bc1737Fb996B7f63AC0 (NFT contract deployed in 80001 Mumbai).

`NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_POLICY` is the ID of a [Policy](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api/policies#create-a-policy) for your contract. A policy has a contract and chain_id. For this demo to work, the policy must have both the contract and the register sessions as rules.


**4. Follow the server instructions on how to run**

Install & Run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```
